# Custom cache

This project shows how to use the cache feature, but instead of use it directly, I created it using adapters to change the 
implementation on the startup and keeps the logic on the controllers.

The settings file contains the parameters needed to use it. 

The cache adapter can be changed on the startup file.

## Instructions ##

- Clone the repository
- Run the project on vs or using the command line.
- Go to /api/values
- Refresh the page after 2 or 3 seconds to see the new cached value.

By default the value is cached during 5 seconds, so, after that time you will see a new value.
